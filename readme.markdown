# Dance Video to Robot Skeleton

This project transforms a dance video into a video where a colored skeleton reproduces the dancer's movements. It uses MediaPipe for pose detection and OpenCV for drawing the skeleton.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (preferably via Miniconda)
- FFmpeg (installed and added to the PATH)

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment with Miniconda:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n dance_robot python=3.8
   conda activate dance_robot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install FFmpeg:**

   - Download FFmpeg from ffmpeg.org.
   - Add it to your system PATH.

## Usage

1. Place your dance video (`input_video.mp4`) in the current directory.

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python dance_robot.py
   ```

3. The annotated video will be saved in `dance_analysis_output/annotated_video_v02.mp4`.

## requirements.txt

```
opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
```

## Library Origins and Licenses

- **OpenCV**: opencv.org, Apache 2.0 License
- **MediaPipe**: mediapipe.dev, Apache 2.0 License
- **NumPy**: numpy.org, BSD License
- **FFmpeg**: ffmpeg.org, LGPL or GPL License (depending on configuration)

## How It Works

1. **Pose Detection**: MediaPipe extracts body keypoints from each frame of the input video.
2. **Interpolation**: Missing poses are filled with the last valid pose.
3. **Skeleton Drawing**: OpenCV draws a colored skeleton on the frames based on the detected poses.
4. **Audio Addition**: FFmpeg recombines the original audio with the annotated video.

This project is a simple demonstration to share accessible tools on GitHub.
